# MODULE 2 - FINAL PROJECT

GAME APP NAME:   `So-You-Think-You-Can-Drink`

## Objectives

This game app is created for minimum of three(3) playerss to compete through dance battles (which involves a variety of dance genres) and the loser consumes few drinks. Two(2) players to battle and the other players vote.

## Overview
We used ruby on rails, a web application framework to create our application.

In this app, we are dealing with a many-to-many relationship: between a Player model and a Challenge model connected through a Turn model. A player has many challenges, a challenge has many players, and a turn belongs to both the player and the challenge. We also created three(3) forms, a form for creating new players, the second form for creating new challenges and the last form is a voting form which allows the players to vote.

### Understanding our Program
- A user will run the program, and on the first page, a welcome message is displayed from So-You-Think-You-Can-Drink! which also includes the instructions of how to play the game.

- The user will then be prompted to select from the list below:
        -START GAME
            -To begin battles, minimum of three(3) players must be created
        -VIEW CHALLENGES
            -List all the random challenges
        -ADD CUSTOM CHALLENGES
            -This option is available for players that want to battle to their choice of challenge

- When two(2) players are tied, both players will be prompted to compete with a tie breaker game.
    

### `Summary`
This goal of this web app is for our users to have fun while drinking and dancing.
